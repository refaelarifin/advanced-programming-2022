cd HandWritting-Digit-Detection
```
First, install virtual environment and create a new virtual environment on python

```shell
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv &&
sudo apt install python3-venv &&
python3 -m venv env
```

then, activate the virtual environment by running

```
Change the EOL from CRLF(windows) TO LF(LINUX). You can use notepad++ EOL conversion for this. Then run the script again. 

# Run
To start detecting images, run this in root folder. (__windows__ user must run this via wsl)
```shell
python3 start.py -f [filename]
```

If you want to detect images in batch (highly recommended if you have multiple images that want to be detected), add -b option
```shell
python3 start.py -b --img_path="/home/img/"
```
